##<h3> Description </h3>

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This simple substitution cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who is reputed to have used it to communicate with his generals.

This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. It uses the `pyfiglet` library to display the software name in a fancy text format.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Convert plain text to cipher text using a specified shift value.
- **Decryption:** Convert cipher text back to plain text using the same shift value.
- **Flexible Shift:** Allows any shift value to be used for both encryption and decryption.
- **Fancy Text Display:** Uses `pyfiglet` to display the software name in a fancy text format.

## Installation

To run this script, you need Python and the `pyfiglet` package installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/username/repository.git](https://github.com/Farhaaaaaaa/CEASAR-CIPHER-/blob/main/README.md)
    cd repository
    ```

2. Install the required package:
    ```bash
    pip install pyfiglet
    ```

## Usage

Run the script with Python to encrypt or decrypt a message. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

2. **Follow the Prompts:**

   - Press `E` to encrypt a plain text or `D` to decrypt a cipher text.
   - Enter the string you want to encrypt or decrypt.
   - Enter the value to shift by (an integer).

### Example

```bash
Press E to encrypt a plain text or D to decrypt a cipher text: E
Enter the string: HELLO
Enter the value to shift by: 3
Encrypted text: KHOOR
